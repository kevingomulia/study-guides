Binary tree questions (BST?)

- Please be sure to talk about your interest in Facebook, accomplishments, current projects, and walk the interviewer through your logic/reasoning during the coding exercise. Your interviewer will be evaluating your code on efficiency, bugs, and timeliness.
- Discuss initial ideas and solutions with your interviewer, which will help you to clarify any ambiguity.
- Take hints from your interviewer to showcase your thought process and problem-solving ability.
- Generally avoid solutions with lots of edge cases or huge if/else if/else blocks. Deciding between iteration and recursion is always an important step.
- Think about different algorithms and algorithmic techniques (sorting, divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming/memorization, recursion).
- Think about data structures, particularly the ones used most often (Array, Stack/Queue, Hashset/Hashmap/Hashtable/Dictionary, Tree/Binary Tree, Heap, Graph, Bloom Filter, etc.)
- Donâ€™t worry about rote memorization such as runtimes or API/native calls. It's good to know how to figure out approximate runtimes on the fly but the code you write is more important.
- You will be asked about O(Memory) constraints, the complexity of the algorithm you are writing and its runtime - O(N^2), O(N) etc.- Important - think about testing your code throughout the interview
